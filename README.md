Harassment Tracker 2.0 is a tool which aims to help users understand the most up-to-date harassment trends and patterns in user-defined parameters.
The Harassment Tracker can be used by anyone interested in the issue of harassment. However, our tools is especially useful to those directly working to combat harassment. This includes HR staff in industry, government policy maker, school curriculum developer, police, etc. For example, if school administrators see current trends for harassment at school for LGBTQ students in on the rise, they can design special programs to educate students on the topic to provide a safer environment of LGBTQ students. Another example would be if policy makers see a sharp rise in racial harassment after a new immigration policy was implemented, they may need to reconsider how the policy can be implemented to protect immigrants and refugees. 
Harassment Tracker 2.0 has two main functions: 1)Report Harassment and 2)Visualize harassment data. 
Users can report cases of harassment they experienced themselves or someone they know experienced and submit details about the incident anonymously. The tracker collects information about the type of harassment, the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim, the environment where it occurred (school, workplace, etc), geographic location, and other important information on the nature of the incident. 
The data collected is then parsed and organized into a cloud database. The data is retrieved to create data models to extract trends and patterns. The results after processing is presented on the web in charts, heatmaps, pie graphs, etc. to help users easily understand harassment information. Users can choose parameters to specifically look at harassment trends within their city, or trends in schools across the country, or general trends over the past year, etc. 
The user interface is constructed with html/css/javascript and builds off of bootstrap theme. The backend interface to database an database to interface communication is done through php. The database is stored in Amazon AWS MySQL.
